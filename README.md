# Throttle-Quadrant-Project
This Repository contains materials that I used to create a basic throttle quadrant game controller.
This project uses an Arduino Micro with an ATMega32u4 in order to make a throttle game controller.
The "Joystick" library for Arduino by Matthew Heironimus was used in this project.  This project wouldn't be possible without it.
